配置

---
Anaconda安装配置:Anaconda3-5.3.0-Windows-x86_64.exe
# 添加到环境变量,不推荐使用.
[ ] Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable
Not recommended. Instead, open Anaconda with the Windows Start menu and select "Anaconda". This "add to PATH" option makes Anaconda get found before previously installed software, but may cause problems requiring you to uninstall and reinstall Anaconda.
# 将其作为默认python,由于我电脑上已经安装Python3.5.2.不选.
[ ] Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.7
This will allow other problems, such as Python Tools for Visual Studio Pycharm, Wing IDE, PyDev, and MSI binary packages, to automatically detect Anaconda as the primary Python 3.7 on the system.
